    <h2>General:</h2>
    <p><b>Do not</b> divulge personal details of any individual in or outside of this group without their express consent; this is a breach of privacy and includes name, address etc.
    <p>Members must follow <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/terms?hl=en" target="_blank">Niantics Terms of Service</a>, cheating will not be accepted in any form. Any player found cheating will be named, shamed, removed from all groups and reported to Niantic. This includes the user of Map and/or IV scanning bots.
    <p>Please check with an admin before posting links to any other groups and pages that are not Pokemon related. No advertisting is allowed.
    <br><br>
    <h2>Raiding:</h2>
    <p>We aim to keep things as fair as possible to give everyone the best chance so please make sure to obey the following rules:
    <ol>
      <li>(optionally) register with DetectivePikachu, details here: <a href="https://bit.ly/2DGhdfP">Detective Pikachu Bot</a>
      <li>Use the raid chat (and where possible the DetectivePikachu bot) to create, join and keep track of all raids that you're interested in (especially Tier 5 and above). All Tier 5 raids and above attended by members should be posted to the group so everyone has the chance to join; please don't be selfish.
      <li>Be punctual, once a raid meet time is set and agreed upon it cannot be changed unless all participants agree (some players may have other commitments i.e. work that they need to get back to).
      <li>When setting a raid time leave at least 10 minutes between the <b>meet</b> time and the time that the raid boss disappears to allow for any issues for example; GPS drift / network connectivity.
      <li>Issue a 5 minute warning 5 minutes before the start time ("Enter lobby" time shown in <b>bold</b> by DetectivePikachu) before starting. This is required for all major raids (Tier 5 and above), especially where remote raiders or invites are involved. 
      <li>Start only once the warning has elapsed. This ensures all group members are clear about timings, including those driving or joining remotely or by invitation.
      <li>Split larger groups (15+) into teams of high and low level players (where applicable) to maximise chances and in-game bonuses.
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>Unfair Gameplay:</h2>
    <p>If you break the rules üò°, you will be warned. If you continue to ignore the rules, you will be removed from all groups. If you don't like these rules, please feel free to leave the group, we will not be offended. 
    <p>Finally, if you experience any unfriendly or aggressive behaviour; please report it to a group admin: <a href="https://t.me/DanAngelus">@DanAngelus</a> (Dan), <a href="https://t.me/marinesole">@marinesole</a> (Julia) or <a href="https://t.me/SILVER442">@SILVER442</a> (Colin).
    <p>Let's all help each other enjoy the game as a community.
