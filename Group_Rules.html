    <br><br>
    <h2>Raiding:</h2>
    <p>We aim to keep things as fair as possible to give everyone the best chance so please make sure to obey the following rules:
    <ol>
      <li>(optionally) register with DetectivePikachu, details here: <a href="https://bit.ly/2DGhdfP">Detective Pikachu Bot</a>
      <li>Use the raid chat (and where possible the DetectivePikachu bot) to create, join and keep track of all raids that you're interested in (especially Tier 5 and above). All Tier 5 raids and above attended by members should be posted to the group so everyone has the chance to join; please don't be selfish.
      <li>Be punctual, once a raid meet time is set and agreed upon it cannot be changed unless all participants agree (some players may have other commitments i.e. work that they need to get back to).
      <li>When setting a raid time leave at least 10 minutes between the <b>meet</b> time and the time that the raid boss disappears to allow for any issues for example; GPS drift / network connectivity.
      <li>Issue a 5 minute warning 5 minutes before the start time ("Enter lobby" time shown in <b>bold</b> by DetectivePikachu) before starting. This is required for all major raids (Tier 5 and above), especially where remote raiders or invites are involved. 
      <li>Start only once the warning has elapsed. This ensures all group members are clear about timings, including those driving or joining remotely or by invitation.
      <li>Split larger groups (15+) into teams of high and low level players (where applicable) to maximise chances and in-game bonuses.
    </ol>
    <br>
