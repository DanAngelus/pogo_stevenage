    <h1>Pok√©mon Go Stevenage - Raid Chat Rules</h1>
    <h2>Group Rules and Guidelines:</h2>
    <p>‚ùóÔ∏è No vulgarity, profanity, bullying or prejudice of any kind is permitted in chat (including abbreviations and ****), let's keep it family friendly.
    <br><br>
    <h2>When you first join the group:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Submit a screenshot of your in-game profile via PM to one of the Group Admins (Colin - @SILVER442, Dan - @DanAngelus666, Julia - @marinesole or Dave - @dbm177) showing your current level and in-game name (required).
      <li>Set your Telegram username and <i>optionally</i> register with the DetectivePikachu Raid bot (see the pinned post in the raid chat or ask an admin).
      <li>Say hello üëã in Random Chat!
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>General:</h2>
    <p><b>Do not</b> divulge personal details of any individual in or outside of this group without their express consent; this is a breach of privacy and includes name, address etc.
    <p>Cheating will not be accepted, any player found cheating will be named, shamed and removed from all groups. They will also be reported to Niantic by multiple players.
    <p>Check with an admin before posting links to any other groups and pages that are not Pokemon related.
    <br><br>
    <h2>Raiding:</h2>
    <p>We aim to keep things as fair as possible to give everyone the best chance so please make sure to obey the following rules:
    <ol>
    <li>Use the raid chat and DetectivePikachu bot to create, join and keep track of all raids that you're interested in (especially T4 and T5). All T4/T5 raids attended by members must be posted to the group so everyone has the chance to join; please don't be selfish.
    <li>Be punctual, once a raid meet time is set and agreed upon it cannot be changed unless all participants agree (some players may have other commitments i.e. work that they need to get back to).
    <li>When setting a raid time leave at least 15 minutes between the <b>meet</b> time and the time that the raid boss disappears to allow for any issues for example; GPS drift / network connectivity.
    <li>Issue a 10 minute warning at the time shown in <b>bold</b> by DetectivePikachu (this is the meet time) before starting. This is required for all major (T4/T5) raids. 
    <li>Start only when the 10 minute warning has elapsed. This ensures all group members are clear about timings, including those driving.
    <li>Use a private group for T4 and T5 raids to prevent cheaters from joining the lobby and benefitting. Look around for any people playing to invite them to join (regardless of whether or not they are group members). 
    <li>Split larger groups (15+) into teams of Instinct, Mystic & Valor to maximise chances and in-game bonuses i.e. extra balls. If this is not possible then split the group into equal numbers with a balance of over and under level 30.
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>Unfair Gameplay:</h2>
    <p>If you break the rules üò°, you will be warned. If you continue to ignore the rules, you will be removed from all groups. If you don't like these rules, please feel free to leave the group, we will not be offended. 
    <p>Finally, if you experience any unfriendly or aggressive behaviour; please report it to a group admin: @SILVER442 (Colin), @DanAngelus (Dan), @marinesole (Julia) or @dbm177 (Dave).
    <p>Let's all help each other enjoy the game as a community.
    <p>Please feel free to contact us if you have any other concerns üëç.
