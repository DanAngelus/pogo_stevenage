    <h1>Detective Pikachu Bot Guide</h1>
    <p>In order to use the bot you must at least set your Telegram username (doesn't need to match your Trainer name).

    <h2>How to Set Your Telegram Username</h2>
    <p class="no-space">- Tap your profile photo/icon to open the menu.
    <p class="no-space">- Select Settings then Username.
    <p class="no-space">- Enter your chosen username and tap the ‚úîÔ∏è to save.

    <p>(If you'd prefer NOT to register with @detectivepikachubot and only use it to join raids then stop here but please be warned that you will lose out on many of the benefits and features of Detective Pikachu.)


    <h2>How to Register with Detective Pikachu</h2>
    <p>To start, send a private message to @detectivepikachubot
    <p class="no-space">- iPhone: click @detectivepikachubot, then Send Message</p>
    <p class="no-space">- Android: click @detectivepikachubot</p>
    <p>In PM with @detectivepikachubot, click Start
    <p class="no-space">Send /register followed by your in-game name when asked.
    <p class="no-space">The bot will ask you to nickname a particular Pok√©mon and set it as your buddy, i.e Bulbasaur named Olive
    <p class="no-space">Follow the instructions carefully and take a screenshot of your Trainer profile (careful not to change the position of your trainer) and send this to the bot.
    <p class="no-space">Wait for a success message to appear.
    <br>
    <p>To change your team or level in future simply send another screenshot to the bot and it will update automatically.

    <p style="font-style:italic">[NOTE] that @detectivepikachubot is only active in this group and cannot read your private messages or access any other groups / channels.</p>


    <h2>Using Detective Pikachu</h2>
    <p class="no-space">Once registered, you can begin a raid using one of these methods:
    <ol>
    	<li>Send screenshot of the Egg / Pok√©mon to the Raid Chat
    	<li>Send "/raid" to the Raid Chat and select which time and Pok√©mon
    	<li>Send "/raid pokemon meettime gym" i.e. "/raid pidgey 14:00 clock tower" (without quotes)
	</ol>
    <p>Once a raid has been posted you must register yourself as attending by clicking [üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Join] (also click +1 if bringing 1 or more additional accounts) as this will help to determine if the raid boss can be beaten.

    <p>If you need to change the time of the raid, after joining the raid; reply to the raid announcement message with the new meet time (you don't need to be the one who created the raid), for example:
    /time 13:00

    <p>Once you have arrived at a raid tap [‚úÖ There] to let the other players know.

    <p>If you need to back out of the raid after joining then tap [üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Quit] to remove yourself.
     
    <p>If a raid isn't going ahead due to too few participants then the raid can be cancelled (notifying everyone who joined) by replying to the announcement with /cancel

    <p>Once the raid has completed you can use the [üëç Gotcha] and [üåü Shiny] buttons to show if you caught it and if it's shiny.

    <p>If you're looking to join a raid try PMing @detectivepikachubot using /raids to find any that have already been posted.


    <h2>Issues</h2>
