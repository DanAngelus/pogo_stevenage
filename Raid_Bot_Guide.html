    <h2>Using Detective Pikachu</h2>
    <p class="no-space">Once registered, you can begin a raid using one of these methods:
    <ol>
    	<li>Send screenshot of the Egg / Pok√©mon to the Raid Chat
    	<li>Send "/raid" to the Raid Chat and select which time and Pok√©mon
    	<li>Send "/raid pokemon meettime gym" i.e. "/raid pidgey 14:00 clock tower" (without quotes)
	</ol>
    <p>Once a raid has been posted you must register yourself as attending by clicking [üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Join] (also click +1 if bringing 1 or more additional accounts) as this will help to determine if the raid boss can be beaten.

    <p>If you need to change the time of the raid, after joining the raid; reply to the raid announcement message with the new meet time (you don't need to be the one who created the raid), for example:
    <span style="font-family:monospace">/time 13:00</span>

    <p>If the bot hasn't recognised the correct gym from your screenshot, you can change the gym by replying to the raid announcement message with: <span style="font-family:monospace">/gym {correct gym name}</span>

    <p>Once you have arrived at a raid tap [‚úÖ There] or if raiding remotely tap [üì° Remote] to let the other players know.
	  <p style="margin-left: 2em;font-style:italic"><b>Note:</b> If you're inviting another player make sure that they are added as a remote raider to keep the count correct (this will help to identify when we need to split groups)</p>

    <p>If you need to back out of the raid after joining then tap [üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Quit] to remove yourself.
     
    <p>If a raid isn't going ahead due to too few participants then the raid can be cancelled (notifying everyone who joined) by replying to the announcement with /cancel

    <p>Once the raid has completed you can use the [üëç Gotcha] and [üåü Shiny] buttons to show if you caught it and if it's shiny.

    <p>If you're looking to join a raid try PMing <a href="https://t.me/DetectivePikachuBot">@DetectivePikachuBot</a> using /raids to find any that have already been posted.
