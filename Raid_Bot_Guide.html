    <h2>Using Detective Pikachu</h2>
    <p class="no-space">Once registered, you can begin a raid using one of these methods:
    <ol>
    	<li>Send screenshot of the Egg / Pokémon to the Raid Chat (recommended)
        <li>Send <pre>/raid</pre>" to the Raid Chat and select which time and Pokémon
        <li>Send <pre>/raid pokemon meettime gym</pre> i.e. <pre>/raid pidgey 14:00 clock tower</pre>
    </ol>
    <p>Once a raid has been posted you must register yourself as attending by clicking [🙋‍♀️ Join] (also click +1 if bringing 1 or more additional accounts) as this will help to determine if the raid boss can be beaten.
    <p style="margin-left: 2em;font-style:italic" class="no-space"><b>Note:</b> <i>If joining remotely tap [📡 Remote] to indicate this, otherwise we will assume you will be at the gym and excluded from the remote raiders count (this could mean you are unable to join the lobby and miss out!).</i>
    
<!--
    <p>If you are joining directly and are able to invite someone, tap the [<i>x trainer(s) asking for invitation</i>] link, this will take you to PM with DetectivePikachu, tap [<i>Start</i>] and wait for the list of invitees to popup. Tap the names of the player(s) that you are inviting and they will be sent your trainer code automatically by DetectivePikachu so they can add you as a friend (if not already).
    <p>If you'd like to be invited, tap the [🙏 Invite me] button and wait to be invited. Once someone agrees to invite you, the 👨‍❤️‍👨 icon will appear next to your trainer name on the raid announcement.
    <p style="margin-left: 2em;font-style:italic" class="no-space"><b>Note:</b> <i>You must have registered with DetectivePikachu and submitted your trainer code in order to use this feature</i>
-->

    <p>If you need to change the time of the raid, after joining the raid; reply to the raid announcement message with the new meet time (you don't need to be the one who created the raid), for example:
    <span style="font-family:monospace">/time 13:00</span>

    <p>If the bot hasn't recognised the correct gym from your screenshot, you can change the gym by replying to the raid announcement message with: <span style="font-family:monospace">/gym {correct gym name}</span>

    <p>Once you have arrived at a raid tap [✅ There] or if raiding remotely tap [📡 Remote] to let the other players know.
    <p style="margin-left: 2em;font-style:italic"><b>Note:</b> <i>If you're inviting another player make sure that they add themselves as a remote raider to keep the count correct (this will help to identify when we need to split groups)</i></p>

    <p>If you need to back out of the raid after joining then tap [🙅‍♀️ Quit] to remove yourself.
     
    <p>If a raid isn't going ahead due to too few participants then the raid can be cancelled (notifying everyone who joined) by replying to the announcement with /cancel

    <p>Once the raid has completed you can use the [👍 Gotcha] and [🌟 Shiny] buttons to show if you caught it and if it's shiny.

    <p>If you're looking to join a raid try PMing <a href="https://t.me/DetectivePikachuBot">@DetectivePikachuBot</a> using /raids to find any that have already been posted.
