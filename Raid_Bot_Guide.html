    <h2>Using Detective Pikachu</h2>
    <p class="no-space">Once registered, you can begin a raid using one of these methods:
    <ol>
    	<li>Send screenshot of the Egg / Pokémon to the Raid Chat
    	<li>Send "/raid" to the Raid Chat and select which time and Pokémon
    	<li>Send "/raid pokemon meettime gym" i.e. "/raid pidgey 14:00 clock tower" (without quotes)
	</ol>
    <p>Once a raid has been posted you must register yourself as attending by clicking [🙋‍♀️ Join] (also click +1 if bringing 1 or more additional accounts) as this will help to determine if the raid boss can be beaten.

    <p>If you need to change the time of the raid, after joining the raid; reply to the raid announcement message with the new meet time (you don't need to be the one who created the raid), for example:
    <span style="font-family:monospace">/time 13:00</span>

    <p>If the bot hasn't recognised the correct gym from your screenshot, you can change the gym by replying to the raid announcement message with: <span style="font-family:monospace">/gym {correct gym name}</span>

    <p>Once you have arrived at a raid tap [✅ There] or if raiding remotely tap [📡 Remote] to let the other players know.

    <p>If you need to back out of the raid after joining then tap [🙅‍♀️ Quit] to remove yourself.
     
    <p>If a raid isn't going ahead due to too few participants then the raid can be cancelled (notifying everyone who joined) by replying to the announcement with /cancel

    <p>Once the raid has completed you can use the [👍 Gotcha] and [🌟 Shiny] buttons to show if you caught it and if it's shiny.

    <p>If you're looking to join a raid try PMing @detectivepikachubot using /raids to find any that have already been posted.
